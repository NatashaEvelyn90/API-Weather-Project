This is a project that we are learning in class and it is how to grab and generate information with using API.
For this particular one, we had to use information from the NOAA website and to add a 7 day forecast that shows our location and it should generate and populate your location.

Image below is what my homepage looks like.
Currently the links at the top are not live and are purely for decoration. Possibly might make them live in the future?

Also, I am a huge music person and I konw standard is not to have music on webpages (as it apparently is not great to have) but I had to add music as it matches the themes for the page. However if the music becomes a problem, I did add a pause button that is there for your usage. 


I also did mention "THEMES". I figured out how to set a theme for certain time frames throughout the day.  If you are lucky, you might be able to catch them all! How many can you find?
